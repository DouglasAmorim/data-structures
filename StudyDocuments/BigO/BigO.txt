BigO

How can we compare two differents codes for the same solution

TimeComplexity -> the number of operations of a code takes to finalize execution
Why dont mesure in TIME (seconds) ? Because if your 'computer' is 'better' will run 'faster' 

SpaceComplexity -> the space of each solution takes from the memory to execute

Ω - Best case scenario
θ - Average case scenario
O - Worst case scenario 
Technically when called about bigO is always about worst case

ConstantTime : O(1)
DivideAndConquer: O(log n)
Proportional: O(n)
loop within a loop: O(n^2)

Simplify methods: 

- DropConstants: 
Doesnt matter if was O(100n) O(1000n) we can simplify and call O(n)

- Drop non dominants: 
Example : O(nˆ2 + n), Nˆ2 in that case is dominant, so we can represent as just O(nˆ2)

Adding and removing in a LIST is always O(n), where N is the number of parameters in the list
In a list if we are looking fom a VALUE is always O(n), where N is the number of parameters in the list
And when we are looking for a index is O(1)
