Hashtable

Characteristic: 
- Is one way
- Is deterministic 

Separate Chaining: 
- Using a "List" to store another "dictionary" value in a hash address

Linear Probing (Open addressing): 
- When we generate a hash who already has a "dictionary", we jump to the next hash to store de dictionary

A Hashtable with a size of an prime number increases the ammount of randomness for how the key value pairs are going to be distributed through the has table

We consider hashtables implemented by "python" for example as O(1) for set and get.
because the method who generate the hash is more efficient and the memory space is much larger, comporared to what we implemented here
