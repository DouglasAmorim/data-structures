Hashtable

Characteristic: 
- Is one way
- Is deterministic 

Separate Chaining: 
- Using a "List" to store another "dictionary" value in a hash address

Linear Probing (Open addressing): 
- When we generate a hash who already has a "dictionary", we jump to the next hash to store de dictionary

A Hashtable with a size of an prime number increases the ammount of randomness for how the key value pairs are going to be distributed through the has table
