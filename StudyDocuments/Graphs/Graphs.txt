Graphs is composed of Vertices and Edges
Vertices are the same of Nodes, and Edges are the conection between vertices. 
In graph each Edge has a values, with this values we can calculate the weight of the path between each node


Edges can be directional or bidirectional. Can be weighted or not weighted.
